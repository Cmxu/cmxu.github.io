I am a PhD Student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research interests lie in *robust* and *formally verifiable* machine learning. Specifically, I am currently focused on exploring adversarial examples and leveraging them to understand the behavior of deep learning systems. I am also interested in robust generation of adversarial examples, neural network repair, neural network verification, and the intersection of explainable and robust ML.

I am currently working on a PhD in Computer Science at UIUC working with [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](ggndpsngh.github.io). I previously obtained my Masters and Bachelors at Washington University in St. Louis in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Angelina Lee](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/home_page/) and [Prof. Kunal Agrawal](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/). 

I am always excited to talk about new ideas in adversarial/robust/certifiable machine learning, computer vision, and other deep learning theory topics. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:cx23@illinois.edu) anytime.
