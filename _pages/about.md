I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am focused on making trustworthy ML techniques usable in the real world. My research lies at the
intersection between ML and formal methods. I am broadly interested in the generation of practical adversarial examples, certified training, and neural network verification for the vision, NLP, and wireless application areas.

I am currently working on a PhD in Computer Science at UIUC working with [Prof. Gagandeep Singh](https://ggndpsngh.github.io). Before my PhD, I spent two years working at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences) in the Cybersecurity/ML group. I previously obtained my Masters and Bachelors at Washington University in St. Louis in 2018 where I worked with [Prof. Angelina Lee](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/home_page/) and [Prof. Kunal Agrawal](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/).

I am always excited to talk about new ideas in adversarial/robust/certifiable machine learning, computer vision, and other trustworthy ML topics. Feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:cx23@illinois.edu) anytime.
